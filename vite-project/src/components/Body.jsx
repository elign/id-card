            Hi I'm a video content creator in Ed tech from past two Years, and a teacher from past five years. Currently, I'm working at Website Learners as a Video host, a YouTube channel based in Chennai, India.            </p>

            <p>
                I love learning new things and React is one of them! See this is my first project which I've built from scratch, and there are more to come. I also love teaching, and making difficult tech topics easier for people.
